# ESP8266 Muscle Sensor EMG Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP8266 microcontroller to monitor muscle activity using an EMG (Electromyography) sensor. The sensor reads the electrical activity produced by muscles and the ESP8266 processes this data, detecting muscle activity based on a predefined threshold.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **EMG Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the EMG Sensor to ESP8266:**
   - Connect the analog output pin of the EMG sensor to the `A0` pin on the ESP8266.
   - Ensure proper power (VCC) and ground (GND) connections between the ESP8266 and the EMG sensor.
   
#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support installed.
   - Create a new sketch and paste the provided Arduino code.
   - Connect the ESP8266 to your computer, select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

2. **Operation:**
   - After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor (baud rate: 115200).
   - The Serial Monitor will display the EMG sensor readings.
   - When muscle activity is detected (EMG value exceeds the threshold), a message will be displayed.

#### Applications
- **Health Monitoring:** Monitor muscle activity for rehabilitation and physical therapy.
- **Sports Science:** Analyze muscle performance during exercise.
- **Human-Machine Interfaces:** Control devices based on muscle movements.

#### Notes
- **Threshold Value:** The threshold value (`500` in the example) can be adjusted based on the specific sensor and application needs.
- **Sampling Rate:** The delay of `100ms` can be modified to change the sampling rate of the EMG sensor readings.
- **Serial Communication:** Ensure the Serial Monitor is set to the correct baud rate (115200) to properly display the readings.
